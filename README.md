# nand2tetris hack assembler
This is a command line assembler for the nand2tetris-hack assembly language.

A Makefile is included in the files to handle compilation of the code.

Open the command line or terminal.

```
cd <path/to/project>
make
```

Note: `make` command should be available to compile the program. One way to have it available is to install the gcc compiler. Also it should be included in the `PATH` environment variable.
